## DISASSEMBLING VISUAL BASIC APPLICATIONS \- II


</div>

### Description

This article is an update of the first tutorial that shows how simple it is to disassemble and understand VB programs.

Based on Feedback, I've added a few more sections and edited some text.

This is the 'trailer' to what's coming up next. The next tutorial will continue where this one will stop.

So instead of updates, you'll be finding a multipart tutorial which packs in a lot more important stuff without repeating the old information.

So go ahead and read this , so you can make the most of the big one's...coming up real soon.

I'd like it if you could VOTE for me as well as give me feedback on what you want in the next tutorial, and post about what's good and what's not in this one.
